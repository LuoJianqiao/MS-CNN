MS-CNN
1 overviews
The multi-task CNN with soft labels (MS-CNN) is a novel classification model. I realize the MS-CNN based on  Alex, ResNet, and VGG, respectively. The corresponding folders are ‘based_on_Alex’, ‘based_on_ResNet’, and ‘based_on_VGG’. Here we provider two public remote sensing datasets, the AID (the paper proposing the AID is ‘’), and the NR(the paper proposing the NR is ‘’).
